xmppforum is mostly self-containing, and uses only Python-based
dependencies. However, some of those dependencies are based on C code and,
therefore, it's easier to install them using distribution methods.

To set up a virtual environment with all django dependencies, you can just
run "python bootstrap.py". However, you will still need some more python
libraries.

You can instead use "python bootstrap.py -c" if you want those compiled &
installed as well (which requires, at least, GCC and git).

Or, if you're running Debian or similar distribution, you can try using
"python bootstrap.py -d" after installing some packages by running

  aptitude install python-django python-imaging python-wokkel \
    python-django-treebeard python-django-registration python-simplejson git

.

After running bootstrap, you get the 'ENV' directory.
Change dir to "jforum",
 add option overrides to settings_local.py (copy from settings.py what needs
   to be changed)
 and then run:

   ../ENV/bin/python manage.py syncdb

to create a default database (it will ask few questions). After that, you
 can

   ../ENV/bin/python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

to start the django development server, and

   ../ENV/bin/python $(which twistd) -y jaboardxmpp.tac -n --pidfile \
     jaboardxmpp.pid

to run XMPP server (or you can use explicit path to twistd).

Note, however, that to successfully use XMPP server you will likely need a
DNS setup with an externally accessible address.

XMPP server is configured in django's settings as well (i.e.
settings_local.py). Without extra SRV records, port 5269 should be used.

And, if you even attempt to run xmppforum - whether successfully or not -
please tell me about the results :)
