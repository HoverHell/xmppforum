-- xmppface:
  * put run_... stuff into management commands
  * ?? Should it be usable without django settings? Or
   django-dummy-settings-mechanisms are good enough to not care?
  * [in progress] ? registration-related XMPP workflow?
  * ! move xmpp_... views into this package.
  * !! move sb_usersettings__jid into some more general place.
  ...
  * allow custom 404 / 500 / ... handlers?
  * Add customizable prefixes for all cache.* stuff (at least in a separate
   module)
  ...
  * almost done: !! Make it a separate module/app! 

-- ?
  * Add various triggers for forced grabbing of the JID's avatar?

-- snapbase:
  * Allow censoring own posts?
  * Check if user has the permission to add new thread / new post for
   showing the new_thread / reply links.
  * Fix abusereport admin: it should point to Post editing but points to the
   abusereport editing instead.
  * Decide on sortlatest post sorting in the thread.
    ? If it is good enough â€” store latest_answer in the db (updating it the
     same way as numchildren) and sort by it (descending) everywhere?
  * ! Decide what to do with avatar_url templatetag caching (it is NOT
   cached as a templatetag in the latest django-avatar revision!)
   * https://github.com/ericflo/django-avatar/issues/19 
  * [done] fix / implement post revisions. Problem is:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4870802/
    * ! rework related javascript to grab all revisions (RPC 'getrevisions')
     and then display them as asked?
  ...
  * Review CSRF protection stuff. References:
   http://djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter16/
  * Review AJAXy stuff. References:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4740569/ajax-views-with-django
   / django-piston?
  * Try to DRY the settings view regarding Avatar.  If impossible - move
   the avatar settings away after all.
   * ! Problem: combined select-default & delete form is used, which
    requires some copied code after all. But still might be able to
    minimize.
  * Try to DRY notification XMPP support. Looks like might have to find out
   what django-notification developer meant for such stuff. (Unanswered
   question at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2562492/ ).

  * Move Anonymous support into a separate app?
