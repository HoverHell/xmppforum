  * put run_... stuff into management commands
  * ?? Should it be usable without django settings? Or
   django-dummy-settings-mechanisms are good enough to not care?
  * [in progress] ? registration-related XMPP workflow?
  * ! move xmpp_... views into this package.
  * !! move sb_usersettings__jid into some more general place.
  ...
  * allow custom 404 / 500 / ... handlers?
  * Add customizable prefixes for all cache.* stuff (at least in a separate

  * Fix abusereport admin: it should point to Post editing but points to the
   abusereport editing instead.
  * Decide on sortlatest post sorting in the thread.
    ? If it is good enough â€” store latest_answer in the db (updating it the
     same way as numchildren) and sort by it (descending) everywhere?
  * fix / implement post revisions. Problem is:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4870802/
    * in process.
    * ! rework related javascript to grab all revisions (RPC 'getrevisions')
     and then display them as asked.

  * Try to DRY the settings view regarding Avatar.  If impossible - move
   the avatar settings away after all.

   question at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2562492/ ).

  * Move Anonymous support into a separate app?
