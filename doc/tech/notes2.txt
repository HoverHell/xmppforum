* Post revisions:
 #1: Special place (in the tree) for old revisions.
   Hidden category "[internals]" / thread "[revisions]" / post "[here]" ->
    children
   (-) clutters the category tree.
 #2: separate data.
   ex.: [PostTree] P123 @ 010204 -> (data) -> [PostData] P123 V3 ->
    (previous) -> [PostData] P123 V2 -> ...
   (-) slightly less obvious Post access.
     (?) can be fixed by __getattr__ ?
   (-) More Confusing Models.
 #3: sane place (new sibling for storing older revision)?
   (-) Extra filtering.
   (-) Possibly confusing numeration.

* XMPP workflows:
 * user -> (new) -> XMPP -> (some login_required view)
  #1 Automatic registration as JID-named user.
   (!?) sa username@ part of the JID if possible?
   +? allow to change name if username == JID?
   ** ? JID as public username?
   + url_for_web_login
  #2 Register cmd with username. [done!]
   + allow to authenticate into existing user with password [done!]
   + change_password cmd! [!]
   ** ? plaintext passwords in IM ?
   + url_for_web_login

  * ? warn XMPP user if not registered (if Anonymous)?

! greeting_msg view! (with saying `request.user`)  
! url_for_web_login

* Web workflows:
 user -> (new) -> web -> register (+optional e-mail)
  ... -> XMPP.
 #1: Enter JID in settings to delegate full access to [done!]
 #2: Password-auth from XMPP. [done!]
 ...?
