== About ==

In short, this is an attempt to build a forum software that is completely
usable over IM (XMPP) text interface (taking Juick as an example), and with
support for neat tree-like structure of messages (taking LiveJournal as an
example) - fixing shortcomings of ideological source projects when possible.
