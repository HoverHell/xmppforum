<em>Command forms:</em><br />
<strong>REGISTER</strong> — Register new user with your JID as username.<br />
<strong>REGISTER User name</strong> — Register new user with specified username and no web login.<br />
<strong>REGISTER User name -p Pass word</strong> — Register new user or attach your JID to existing one.<br />
<br />
Please note that you cannot (yet) change your username, and password if you don't specify one. (e.g. you will not be able to login over web)<br />
That also implies that you will not be able to unify your jabber user and your web user if you register them separately.
